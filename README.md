When you make a creative work (which includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. Unless you include a license
that specifies otherwise, nobody else can copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or 
litigation. Once the work has other contributors (each a copyright holder), “nobody” starts including you.
